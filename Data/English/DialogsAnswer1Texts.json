        "Honey, thanks for participating, I'll send a man",
        "Great idea, sister",
        "No, this is not possible at the moment",
        "Sir Longerpod, I have been warned about your visit. I am ready to assist for the benefit of the Emperor and the empire.",
        "At the moment we do not have that kind of money, maybe a part of the amount will satisfy you? That's all there is.",
        "Yes, Colonel, everything is ready. Take it.",
        "We have no choice. I will give the order.",
        "Yes, Mr. Jameson. I think I can provide some help.",
        "Jacob, I sympathize with your loss. I will order the money to be given to you",
        "Mr. Jameson, how did you get yourself to this? I will help.",
        "Pathetic coward, you get nothing! If I am destined to die here, then I will not do it like a cowardly mouse. Get out and don't interfere with my work.",
        "Nobody has enough. I cannot satisfy your request. But you can stay in the city. We need people.",
        "Mr. Stoner, this is none of your business. The survival of the city is at stake and tough measures are required. Leave my office.",
        "I cannot deny your request, Mr. Stoner. The wall guards will be alerted. Take care.",
        "Give me time until evening, I'll try to come up with something."
